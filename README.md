# Abstract
This project presents a weather forecasting system leveraging machine learning techniques to predict key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Utilizing real-time and historical data from reliable meteorological sources, the system ensures accurate and timely forecasts. The architecture includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction modules, optimized for performance and scalability. Algorithms like Linear Regression and LSTM networks are implemented to enhance accuracy. A user- friendly interface displays forecasts, historical trends, and real-time alerts. Future enhancements include IoT integration for localized monitoring and advanced AI models for long-term predictions, making the system a reliable tool for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.
